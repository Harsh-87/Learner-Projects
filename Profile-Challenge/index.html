        <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
        <p class="skilldesc">Coding helped me develop important problem solving skills that I could use for other purposes.For example,I always wondered how computer makes chess moves so efficiently without a mind but now i think i can make computer think like that .All these things can be applied to everyday tasks such as managing time wisely and efficiently.   </p>

        <h3>Coding</h3>
        <p class="skilldesc">Till the end of my class 12 I was totally unaware about the word coding. My friends used to talk about it frequently so i tried to figure out what it really is. Soon I realized that this is interesting, logical, can earn me money and lastly has a huge scope in future as well as present. So i pulled up my socks and began the journey. It is worth a try. </p>

        <h3>Leadership</h3>
        <p class="skilldesc">I believe that leadership is not just a job, it is an honour. We all work for some or other reasons but hardly any of us get a team to implement our ideas to make work easy. So when I lead some team it gives me immense pleasure to listen teammates, manage and assign things, implement my ideas with their opinion and then celebrate a success. </p>

        <h3>Teamwork</h3>
        <p class="skilldesc">Working in a team is always a very good source of self-development. It teaches you about your flaws and motivates you about your qualities. Teamwork makes me feel more comfortable because when i see people have similar doubts like me, it releases pressure of lagging. Also it gives me a clear picture of my skills.</p>
